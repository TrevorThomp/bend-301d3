## Responsive Web Design

Responsive web design is the approach of building a website that is able to be used on every device and screen size. It's focus is to be responsive for any viewport and for the overall experience of the website to be very similar no matter what device you are using. Typically, those who approach a responsive design will develop the website from a "mobile-first approach", which means you develop the site for smaller devices first, then as the viewport re-sizes you make the necessary adjustments.

## Flexible Layouts

Responsive websites are typically developed using flexible layouts, media queries and flexible media. Instead of using fixed measurements when defining placement of elements, you want to have either relative or flexible units such as percentages. This will help to make things more fluid as the viewport changes on different devices. Media queries are also very useful, especially from a mobile-first approach. They allow you to make certain adjustments when the screen size is at a particular width so that certain "breaks" are made on elements and they can align according to the new viewport.
