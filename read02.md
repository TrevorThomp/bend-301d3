## jQuery

jQuery is a JavaScript file that you include in your web pages. jQuery allows you to easily manipulate the dom by targeting CSS selectors and applying methods to those elements. jQuery is initialized by "$" before the given CSS selector. The first parameter when using the jQuery function is always going to be a CSS selector targeting the elements you are looking to target. Once you have defined your targeted element/elements, you are then able to add jQuery methods that will update the targeted element you defined within the parameter.

## Why jQuery?

Everything that jQuery does is able to be done with pure vanilla JavaScript. However, jQuery allows you to complete such tasks with fewer lines of code, and less complexity. jQuery is also accepted in most browsers and is easy to read and maintain. In conclusion, jQuery once you learn the basic selection and methods, can make your JavaScript easy to maintain and you are able to create responsive applications faster.
