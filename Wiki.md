## Read 01: Responsive Web Design

Responsive web design is the approach of building a website that is able to be used on every device and screen size. It's focus is to be responsive for any viewport and for the overall experience of the website to be very similar no matter what device you are using. Typically, those who approach a responsive design will develop the website from a "mobile-first approach", which means you develop the site for smaller devices first, then as the viewport re-sizes you make the necessary adjustments.

## Flexible Layouts

Responsive websites are typically developed using flexible layouts, media queries and flexible media. Instead of using fixed measurements when defining placement of elements, you want to have either relative or flexible units such as percentages. This will help to make things more fluid as the viewport changes on different devices. Media queries are also very useful, especially from a mobile-first approach. They allow you to make certain adjustments when the screen size is at a particular width so that certain "breaks" are made on elements and they can align according to the new viewport.

## Read 02: jQuery

jQuery is a JavaScript file that you include in your web pages. jQuery allows you to easily manipulate the dom by targeting CSS selectors and applying methods to those elements. jQuery is initialized by "$" before the given CSS selector. The first parameter when using the jQuery function is always going to be a CSS selector targeting the elements you are looking to target. Once you have defined your targeted element/elements, you are then able to add jQuery methods that will update the targeted element you defined within the parameter.

## Why jQuery?

Everything that jQuery does is able to be done with pure vanilla JavaScript. However, jQuery allows you to complete such tasks with fewer lines of code, and less complexity. jQuery is also accepted in most browsers and is easy to read and maintain. In conclusion, jQuery once you learn the basic selection and methods, can make your JavaScript easy to maintain and you are able to create responsive applications faster.
